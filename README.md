# Summary of Project

## HTML
- Main components of project are page header, content area and modal
- Modal contains 2 parts: close button, container

## CSS
Position: fixed
- position fixed fixes element to the viewport, it stays same place even if page is scrolled 
- used to fix the close button as well as fixing the modal background

Relationship of position absolute and position relative
- we have a child element with position: absolute within a parent with position relative
- child element will be positioned relative to the parents dimensions

Visibility
- hides an element WITHOUT changing layout of document
- in this project -> by default, setting a class to hidden (visibility: hidden), and then having another class to make it visable (visibility: visible)
